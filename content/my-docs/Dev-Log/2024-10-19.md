Progess
---
- found a promising library to use for the GFlowNet implementation
- looked more into CLI blender
- refined an idea for a "toy" example 
- progress on dev environment set up
- Documentation set up

Next

Goals:
- explore how long it takes to run the examples in the GflowNet Library
- get a Ubuntu workstation set up
- Test out blender python scripting in background mode
- refine my idea for a loss based on filling a volume

Extras:
- Read all the way through GflowNet Foundation paper
- Really search for a paper that tackles a problem with a similar state space to Blender

Project Description:
---
This project aims to utilize GFlowNets (Generative Flow Networks) to sample 3D models or game assets in proportion to a defined loss function. The loss function serves as a guide, allowing GFlowNets to explore and generate compositions that adhere to certain design principles or target characteristics (e.g., similarity to a reference model, pointiness, or other aesthetic metrics). This approach could significantly accelerate the creative process by proposing a variety of model configurations, streamlining asset creation for game development, or even aiding in automated level design.
Key Goals
---
- **Loss-Guided Sampling**: Use a loss function (such as one based on aesthetics or gameplay functionality) to guide the sampling of possible 3D models or game assets.
- **Automated Exploration**: Enable rapid exploration of potential model configurations, allowing game developers or designers to quickly iterate over a wide variety of possible assets.
- **Creative Assistance**: Use the GFlowNetâ€™s ability to explore high-dimensional spaces to assist artists and designers in discovering unique model compositions that align with their creative goals.
- **Game Development Integration**: Facilitate the integration of these generated assets into game engines like Unity or Unreal for real-time testing and development.
